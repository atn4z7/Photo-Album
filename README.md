This application is a digital photo album that can be used to both view and maintain entries.

There are 2 modes:
- Browse mode (View/Browse): the user is able to move forward or backwards through a list of pictures

- Maintenance mode (View/Maintain): the user is able to update an existing image, update the data associated with an image, delete an image, and add new images.

To access the data, the application uses JDBC API. As a result, the user is free to choose any relational database such as MySQL to store the photos.
